# x11-experiments
A repository full of me experiments involving the X11 display manager thing


------
##Compile.sh
- A little shell script to automatically build all the files and log the changes
to git.
It's really useful, feel free to take and use it for your own projects.

##One
- This is my initial experimentation  with X11, things happen and it doesn't quite currently work, and to be honest, I'm not too bothered about that because it's just an experiment, a plaything, the programmer's equivelant of a proof of concept sketch.

##Two
- This is another proof of concept, but it's written so badly it's embarassing, the next two directories were incremental attempts to refine this initial idea.
